# ruby-test

#If I was to take the time to solve this problem the correct way and in a rails environment:
	-I would create a model to represent the Stocks and their pricing 
	-A Portfolio model to handle the users portfolio 
	-A model to handle the buy and sell methods where we can store the transaction details.
	-If these tasks are run in realtime we would need to create a task to ensure that 
	 these methods are executed accordingly and in the correct fashion
	-The script I currently wrote does execute such commands but uses a global variable to store 
	 the total value whereas in a rails environment I would total the portfolio value and use 
	 that as my value instead and the result would be the same.
